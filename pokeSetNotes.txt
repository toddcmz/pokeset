### Dev notes ###

started with flask backend, mostly to hit API endpoints.
register new user
sign in
add new game score
retrieve game scores

got all of the above working, tested with insomnia.
was not working with token - would need help understanding
this piece.

pushed to render:
https://pokesetapi.onrender.com

Started setting up react front.

Made shells for sign in, register, landing, and play game.
Implemented auth context

he said that we're going to use position and top
on the .btn styling to create animation when
the user hovers over something.

note that this works with .btn:hover because
we're adjusting top by 4px, then subtracting those
4 px off of both shadow colors, with 12 to 8 on teh blue,
and 18 to 14 on the grey underneath. pretty cool.

now we're adding logic using Reducer in this application.

to manage the state of the game, we're going to use reducer.

net ninja Reducer:
pattern of coding which centralizes all of our methods
for changing state into a single function.

IF we have a big program, there might be a bunch of functions
that all change state. If we're having to pass all those functions
as props to our components that use them, then they all have to 
be passed separately. Instead, we could consolidate all those functions
into one reducer function.

This is just a coding pattern. You don't have to use them if you don't
want to.

First we have our reducer function. This interacts with our state and data.
Contains all of our state manipulation logic.

Then we have an action object that describes the type of change we want to make.

Finally we have a dispatch function that sends the action to the reducer.

We call the action, it gets dispatched to the reducer, and it makes the
change to the state.

First we make an action object which describes what we want to make.

	{type:'ADD_BOOK', book:{title=... author=...}} // this is the action

then we dispatch this to the reducer:

	reducer(action, state)

the reducer is going to check the type fo the action, then update the state
we've told it to update based on what it finds. 
-- checks action type
-- updates the state object
-- returns the state

in the above case, it would add a book to the appropriate state.

The syntax is a little complicated, but in essence we're just bunding
all the logic from our separate "state updater" methods and putting
them all into one big method. This is a bit surprising, I wouldn't think
this would jive well with oop ideologies, but hey.

Got into crazy complicated code with not the greatest structure IMO. moving on.
